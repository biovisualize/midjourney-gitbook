# Common process questions

Q: Why is the keyword \[ ] banned?

A: We are working on a better moderating system. For now banning words has proven an effective way to prevent abuses. Some words sound safe but are bringing the model in unexpectedly bad corners in a consistent way. Trying to get around banned words for generating nsfw images is a breach of our guidelines. But using synonymous or other ways is fine when the intent is compliant with the guidelines.



Q: I want to give you money. How could I do it? I don't want to just subscribe.&#x20;

A:

* The best way is to subscribe to the 50$ tier, let it renew, even if you don't use it. If you do, set a high incremental limit
* Transfer money to your friend so they can join
* We don't receive corporate or VC money. We try to build a community and be sustainable only from subscriptions. Sending money directly to MJ is more complex than subscribing currently. But we could send you a Venmo account
* Be successful, make money with MJ over 20K a month or make a custom plan to share % of revenues
