# Tips and tricks

Problem: image prompt url doesn't work

Solution: Upload your image to discord, for example by posting it in your thread, then open the image and copy the image address

Problem: saving all of my images at once

Solution: we don't have a batch download feature yet. The fastest is to go to your web gallery feed, open an image, then click on the save icon. You can use the right arrow to move to the next image and repeat the operation.
